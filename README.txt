HOW TO USE
1. Extract the zip.
2. Place your photo (the one you uploaded) into the same folder and name it exactly 'photo.jpg'.
3. Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
4. Click/Tap anywhere to start the animations.
Notes: No external dependencies. If you want me to embed your exact uploaded photo into the zip, reply 'embed photo' and I will include it directly.
